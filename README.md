# Single-nucleus Profiling Reveals Cell Type-specific Transcriptomic Signatures of Inner Ear Sensory Organs across Aging

## Preamable
- This directory contains illustration of the overall workflow of single-nucleus profiling of inner ear across aging.
- Samples of the sequencing data were sensory organs including cochleae and utricles from C57
